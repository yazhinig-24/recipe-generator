# 🍲 AI Recipe Generator with Cohere

This is a simple Python script that uses the **Cohere AI Chat API** to generate recipes based on ingredients you provide. Just run the script, input ingredients like `"chicken, garlic, tomatoes"`, and get a complete recipe in seconds!

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- Takes a list of ingredients from the user via input.
- Sends the message to Cohere's **`chat` endpoint** using the `command-r-plus` model.
- Returns a full recipe generated by the AI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A [Cohere API key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)
